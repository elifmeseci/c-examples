# C Programming Language

C is one of the most popular programming language in the world. It is a general-purpose programming language and very powerful. It has been used to develop operating systems, databases, applications, etc.


C is very fast, compared to other programming languages. Also, it is the basis for other programming languages.

A C program basically consists of the following parts:

- Preprocessor Commands
- Functions
- Variables
- Statements & Expressions
- Comments

**Header files** are included that add functionality to the program. With the inclusion of header files, the functions inside are used. For example, by including the header file library stdio.h, we use basic functions such as printf(), scanf() to print to the screen, and input from the keyboard.
